## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA alongside data cleaning was performed in this project to understand the dataset's structure, identify and handle missing values and address any data quality issues.
  - A missing colunm was added, which was the Revenue column which was found by multipling the Quantity by the Unit Price in order to know the Total Sales generated.
  - The data was checked for duplicates by highlighting the whole data in an excel sheet and clicking on the 'Remove Duplicates' in the Data tab interface.

## Data Tools and Methods Used
1. Microsoft Excel 
- For Data Cleaning
- For Analysis utilizing Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the dataset making it easier to identify insights
- For Visualization - Bar charts were used to visually represent key insights
2. Structured Query Language(SQL) for Quering of Data
3. Power BI used for converting data from different data sources to interactive dashbords and BI reports.
