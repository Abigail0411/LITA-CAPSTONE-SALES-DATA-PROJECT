  *  The percentage of total sales contributed by each region
  * The products with no sales in the last quarter
    
## Data Tools and Methods Used
1. Microsoft Excel 
- For Data Cleaning
- For Analysis utilizing Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the dataset making it easier to identify insights
- For Visualization - Bar charts were used to visually represent key insights
2. Structured Query Language(SQL) for Quering of Data
3. Power BI used for converting data from different data sources to interactive dashbords and BI reports.

## Data Analysis
Some formulars, functions, queries were used during the analysis, which are as follows;
### Excel formulars used
- Total Sales = Quantity * Unit price
- AVERAGEIF(range,criteria,[average_range]): Used to calculate the Average sales per Product
